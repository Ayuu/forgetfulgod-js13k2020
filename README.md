#### Comments from experts

[Nathan Lie](https://twitter.com/feraltc): Excellently crafted puzzle game with some real brain teasers in there. Easily one of the strongest qualities about this game though, are the quality of life features - color accessibility, a easily accessible help menu, and progression saving go a long way. The Web Monetization feature only adds onto these helpful features, so I think it's a good choice.

[Anselm Hook](https://twitter.com/anselm): Cute. Complicated. Monetization seems ok.

[Ewa Mazur](https://twitter.com/mypoint13k): I like the game dynamic (thanks to music). Bonuses for Coil subscribers did the job, I'm not sure if I wouldn't be frustrated without them ;)

[Christer Kaitila](https://twitter.com/mcfunkypants): I love the css3d graphics of the main character. I also really appreciated the accessibility features, they were a great improvement! Lovely puzzles, which were greatly helped by having the coil bonus cheat sheet. Wonderful work!

[Jupiter Hadley](https://twitter.com/Jupiter_Hadley): Really fun puzzle game, I quite enjoyed them!

#### Comments from testers

[Miguel Ángel](https://github.com/zlash): Nice twist on the pushing puzzle genre! Sometimes guessing the color mix was not super intuitive so I ended up testing everything against everything but anyway it was fun!

[Josep del Rio](https://github.com/joseprio): The concept seems interesting, but the combinations of the different pieces didn't seem too intuitive to me. Also, the fog serves no purpose; in my opinion, monetization should enhance the game, not hinder it unless people pay.

[Michael Marcucci](https://github.com/Cutch): Nice puzzle game I enjoyed the content in the puzzles

[Salvatore Previti](https://github.com/SalvatorePreviti): A very nice puzzle game! Music is good, sound effects are good, and I like the idea of mixing things together. The only negative thing is that there are too many things to remember, H and I helps but a bit of more simplicity would have helped.

[Stanisław Małolepszy](https://github.com/stasm): Really cool Sokoban-like idea! The puzzles are quite challenging but rewarding. I had trouble making out different shapes at first, and the color blending rules get... complicated :)

[Mark Racette](https://github.com/mracette): Really smooth and easy to play! I like the focus on accessibility with the colors. Kind of confusing at first but easier once you get the hang of it.

[Stephen Styrchak](https://github.com/badcorporatelogo): I like that progress is saved automatically. Pretty cool.

[Nicholas Carlini](https://github.com/carlini): Very nice game. Well put together.

[Cody Ebberson](https://github.com/codyebberson): Excellent puzzle game! Impressive use of css3d. The main character model is awesome. Nice job!

[eguneys](https://github.com/eguneys): Nice idea, but I can't memorize what turns into what, and hard to tell what is a pyramid or other thing.

[Markus Fisch](https://github.com/markusfisch): Fun game! Well done!

[Aurélio A. Heckert](https://github.com/aurium): I'm pretty sure that i did the right mix, however it did not match the locker. You could use more screen space. I had only a small circle in my screen where the game happens.

[Jerome Lecomte](https://github.com/herebefrogs): I'm not a big fan of the emoji style, but the puzzles are very interesting

[Viljami Peltola](https://github.com/viljami): Real brain cracker! The game got more difficult in really good steps. When there was more than one new feature introduced on a level it was a bit difficult. The music was awesome! And the sfx too.
